# Overengineered HTML Password Generator
I spent way too long on this... It's a web page where you can generate a password. Idk
### How to Run
1. Clone into this repository
2. Serve `index.html` with your favorite web server, or just open it in a browser
3. Profit.

### Features and Usage
**Password length**
- Set how many characters you want in your password with the range slider

**Password character sets**
- Enable including uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols

**Password starting substring**
- Attempt to generate a password with user set prefix
- Note: This does not append characters to the password. It simply attempts to generate random passwords and stops when the generated password starts with the matching prefix. Please read comments in `global.js`!
